# Website-Phishing


Dataset: 
1.	The dataset of phishing websites will be collected from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which is freely available for use. 
2.	This dataset collected 11055 different websites from difference sources,  consists of 6157 legitimate websites out of 11055 websites. 
3.	Phishing websites were collected from PhishTank archive, MillerSmiles archive, Googleâ€™s searching operators.
4.	Link for Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00327/


Action Plan: 
1.	Download dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
2.	After downloading dataset, I will analyze the attribute, and data.
3.	I will build the model using unsupervised and supervised learning techniques.
4.	For unsupervised learning, I will use K-Means and K-Modes Clustering algorithm.
5.	For supervised learning I will use Logistic Regression and Neural Network.

Literature Review:  
Phishing a form of cyber-attack, which has an adverse effect on people where the user is directed to fake websites and duped to reveal their sensitive and personal information which includes passwords of accounts, bank details, atm pin-card details etc. Hence protecting sensitive information from malwares or web phishing is difficult. 
As per research article published by Dr. Rakesh Verma and Dr. Keith Dyer on the Character of Phishing URLs: Accurate and Robust Statistical Learning Classifiers. As per article, they have proposed the combining statistical analysis of website URLs with machine learning techniques will give a more accurate classification of phishing URLs. Using a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test along with other features they were able to accurately classify 99.3% of the dataset, with a false positive rate of less than 0.4%. Thus, accuracy of phishing URL classification can be greatly increased through the use of these statistical measures.

This project examines the applicability of ML techniques in identifying phishing attacks and report their positives and negatives. In specific, there are many ML algorithms that have been explored to declare the appropriate choice that serve as anti-phishing tools. I will design a Phishing Classiﬁcation system which extracts features that are meant to defeat common phishing detection approaches. I will also make use of numeric representation along with the comparative study of classical machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression and Neural Network for supervised machine learning algorithms and K-Means and K-Modes Clustering for unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
